# wright-workflow

Trying out a workflow using [`wright`](https://github.com/porsager/wright) with [`rollup`](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en) for bundling, powered by [`svelte`](http://svelte.technology/) with [`svelte-dev-helper`](https://github.com/ekhaled/svelte-dev-helper) to enable hot-reloading.

Oh, and [`modular-css-rollup`](https://github.com/tivac/modular-css/tree/master/packages/rollup) for styling, naturally.
